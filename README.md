# svm

Support Vector Machine(SVM), is a supervised machine learning model, which classifies data using a hyperplane. Once this hyperplane is discovered, we refer to it as a decision boundary. We do this, because, this is the boundary between being one class or another. Once we calculate this decision boundary, we never need to do it again, unless of course we are re-training the dataset. Thus, this solves the problem of scaling to larger dataset unlike the K-nearest neighbours.
